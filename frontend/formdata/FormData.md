## Introduction
- `FormData` in JavaScript is a useful interface for working with HTML forms, enabling us to easily construct and manipulate form data, especially when sending it via `fetch` or `XMLHttpRequest`.
- It simplifies handling form data by letting us **append** and **retrieve** *key-value* pairs, manage files, and handle encoded form data without needing to manually format it.
- `FormData` is a JavaScript object that allows us to collect form data and send it to a server in a specific format called `"multipart/form-data"`. This is commonly used to send files (like PDFs, images, etc.) or other form data in HTTP requests.'
- When do we use `FormData`?
	- We use `FormData` when you want to send form data (like file uploads) through an HTTP request (e.g., using `fetch()`) to a server.
- This interface provides a way to construct a set of key/value pairs representing form fields and their values, which can be sent using the [`fetch()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/fetch "fetch()"), [`XMLHttpRequest.send()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/send) or [`navigator.sendBeacon()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/sendBeacon) methods.
