# White Space
- The empty areas in a user interface.

## Why is whitespace important?
- If we get rid of the whitespace, The design falls in on itself.
- So we need white spaces.

## White space should be applied based on four factors:
- Space Availability
- Number of Components
- Alignment 
- Consistency

### Space Availability
- Depends on viewport width : On a phone there is less viewport width.
### Number of Components
- Everything outside of our whitespace can be considered as a component or a micro-component
- Components will influence how you apply your white space.
- If you have a phone, and you are seeing a splash page which has just a title and a button, you will be able to have lots of whitespace. But suppose we have news type of website. It will be having lots of components, so less white space.

### Alignment
- How you apply your space depends on alignment.

- In the following, the alignment is not correct between the line and the text in the bottom component.

- So we need to move the 'Book A Trip' button to the left to have proper alignment.

### Consistency
- Suppose we want, the line with the button 'Book a trip' horizontally center.

- But as we can see the white space is not consistent. So we would need to reduce the whitespace.
