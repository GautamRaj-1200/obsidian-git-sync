## Steps to Commit and Push to GitHub for the First Time
1. **Initialize a New Git Repository**:
```bash
git init
```
2. **Create and Switch to the Main Branch**:
```bash
git branch -M main
```
3. **Stage Your Changes**:  Add all files in the current directory to the staging area:
```bash
git add .
```
4. **Commit Your Changes**: Make your initial commit with a message:
```bash
git commit -m "initial commit"
```
5. **Configure Your User Information** (if prompted):  If you haven't set your username and email globally, you may be asked to do so. Run the following commands:
```bash
git config --global user.name "your username" 
git config --global user.email "your email"
```
6. **Set Up Credential Helper** (Optional):  To avoid entering your credentials every time, you can store them securely:
