## Introduction
- SQL is a standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in databases.
- SQL stands for Structured Query Language.
- Although SQL is an ANSI/ISO standard, there are different versions of the SQL language.

However, to be compliant with the ANSI standard, they all support at least the major commands (such as `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `INSERT`, `WHERE`) in a similar manner.
