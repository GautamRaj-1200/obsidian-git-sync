## Introduction
- SQL is a standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in databases.
- SQL stands for Structured Query Language.
- Although SQL is an ANSI/ISO standard, there are different versions of the SQL language.
- However, to be compliant with the ANSI standard, they all support at least the major commands (such as `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `INSERT`, `WHERE`) in a similar manner.

## RDBMS
- RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System.
- RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems such as MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access.
- *The data in RDBMS is stored in database objects called* **tables**. 
	- A **table** is a collection of related data entries and it consists of columns and rows.
	- Every table is broken up into smaller entities called **fields**.
		- A **field** is a column in a table that is designed to maintain specific information about every record in the table.
	- A **record**, also called a row, is each individual entry that exists in a table. It is a horizontal entity in a table.
	- A **column** is a vertical entity in a table that contains all information associated with a specific field in a table.

- Most of the actions we need to perform on a database are done with SQL statements.
- SQL statements consist of keywords that are easy to understand.
- The following SQL statement returns all records from a table named "Customers":
