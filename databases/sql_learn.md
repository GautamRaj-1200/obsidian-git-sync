## Introduction
- SQL is a standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in databases.
- SQL stands for Structured Query Language.
- Although SQL is an ANSI/ISO standard, there are different versions of the SQL language.
- However, to be compliant with the ANSI standard, they all support at least the major commands (such as `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `INSERT`, `WHERE`) in a similar manner.

## RDBMS
- RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System.
- RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems such as MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access.
- The data in RDBMS is stored in database objects called tables. A table is a collection of related data entries and it consists of columns and rows.
